#### Cufflinks_Isoforms

######## You can look for differentially expressed isoforms using Cufflinkins (Villarino et al, Plant Physiology). 
######## The isoform finding can be tricky if you havent sample deeep enough. Also, do not look only at the 5' or 3' UTR, you need to loo at the reads across the CDS. Cuflfinks will make a model that fit the data best (
